// My original notes of how to find the data: 

// Have to call the API through the ".species" to get the "flavour-text-entires" which then give the description
// This also has a "genera" list which contains "genus" and "language" so have to ensure the genus is correct for the english language ("en")

// To find Gender you must go through this link: https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/gender/female/, this link https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/gender/male/, this link https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/gender/genderless/
// and search for the pokemon name. 

// This is the cherish ball png that is used next to the poke description "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PokeAPI/sprites/master/sprites/items/cherish-ball.png"

// To get weaknesses you have to use the "types" URLs and make a successive call to each type in that list and look for "double-damage" (double check)
