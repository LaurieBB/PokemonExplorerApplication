# Pokemon Explorer Application

## Project Setup and Running Instructions

## Design and Component Decisions

### Structure

### Components

The first thing I did to start this project was read through the shadcn/UI docs as I had not previously used this package. On looking through the components I noticed a lot of similarities to the Figma design. Therefore, I actively matched different parts of the Figma design to the different components before even beginning to code. These are shown here:

- Pokemon Type: _Badge_
- Pagiation: _Buttons_
- Search Bar: _Input + Button_
- Pokemon Sections (Both on main page and after search): _Cards_
- Loading State Indicators: _Skeletons/Progress??????_ TODO CHECK THIS AT END
